File Sync Window:
Syncing for Maps, Playermodels, Daryiens Textures, Parkbuilder assetbundles, Garage Custom Meshes (Garage online/offline Url's supported for textures)

If the Server see's something it doesn't have being used, it'll request from player who used it (optional upload),
If your game see's something it doesn't have, the syncwindow will let you request it from server,

On receive of something from the Server, all live player's that have a request in for that item they will reload.
e.g If a player requests a player model you dont have, they will default to daryien, on receive of the correct model the player
will switch to that model
