step 4) Ensure VC_Redist_X86 has been installed, provided in folder but also available from Microsoft, you may need to restart you pc (Strongly linked to "connect to server" doing nothing in game)


step 5) TrickModv2 is inside AssmeblyC and sharedassets2, If you dont have Pipeworks PI and Pipeworks MI and have issues, install those too right next to FrostyPManager in YourGame/Mods/


 Dont Grab them elsewhere and use they're included AssemblyC's, there AssemblyC mods are included in this AssemblyC, but not vice versa









For Hosting:

Step 1) Provide Port forward for your PC, instructions vary on router model but you need to link your internal IP e.g 192.168.1.??? to an internal and external port
on your router, internal ethernet IP addresses dont change, 
if your on WIFI you should setup a static IP so the IP your machine uses wont change on the fly and mess up your port forward.

Step 2) Boot Server App

Step 3) Input Max players count and press enter

Step 4) Enter port to listen (match port setup in Port forwarding) and press Enter

Step 5) Enter TickRate and press enter

Step 6) Enter to go

Step 7) now in Host mode, provide clients with port specified and External IP of your router
