if you have exisiting Multiplayer install:
overwrite your Mods/FrostyPManager/   folder
overwrite your PIPE_Data/FrostyPmanager/  folder
overwrite your PIPE_Data/Custom Players  folder



Manual Setup of FrostyP Game Manager


To install you need 4 things to be done

1) move a folder to your mods folder
2) move a folder to your PIPE_Data folder
3) Overwrite your AssemblyC.dll
4) Install Microsoft .exe included or yourself - Microsoft VC_Redistributable 2015-2019 will get you there on google, this must be 32bit for PIPE






For Game:

step 1) Copy FrostyPGameManager folder from for_games_Mods/  to   YourPIPEfolder/Mods/


step 2) copy the FrostyPGameManager folder from forgamesPIPE_Data/ to your PIPE_Data/ 


step 3) OverWrite your AssemblyC.dll in PIPE_Data/Managed/ with AssemblyC in ForManaged/   (Back yours up!)


step 4) Ensure VC_Redist_X86 has been installed, provided in folder but also available from Microsoft, you may need to restart you pc (Strongly linked to "connect to server" doing nothing in game)

 Dont Grab them elsewhere and use they're included AssemblyC's, there AssemblyC mods are included in this AssemblyC, but not vice versa







For Dedicated Game Server App:





Step 1) Provide Port forward for your PC, instructions vary on router model but you need to access your router as stated when you got it, usually by using your browser and typing 192.168.1.1
Once there the router must have the option to port forward, if you find that option, it will ask for an IP,port numbers and type,
You should only need UDP but TCP/UDP is fine,
then give your IP, which will be listed in the connected devices somewhere and be 192.000.000.000 format,
then choose any port within router specified range and apply,

this will mean anyone who knows to connect to your External IP on that Port wont be blocked by the router and will find your device for as long as your IP and your routers IP stays the same (ethernet is constant)
this usually means just being met with windows defenders, firewalls etc unless an app is there waiting like Microsoft Remote Desktop etc

If the incoming connection meets ValveSockets standards and passes initial connection phases you become connected,

safe to do but for normal users of alot of different apps, nothing like just flipping the port forward off when you dont want it though.

if your on WIFI you should setup a static IP so the IP your machine uses locally wont change on the fly and mess up your port forward.

you can also setup a dynamic Dns for your Router in its browser settings, doing this will mean people can save a url that will always find your router no matter what its IP gets changed to, useful for friends and with
the port forward off it means nothing really anyway


Step 2) Boot Server App

Step 3) Input Max players count and press enter

Step 4) Enter port to listen (match port setup in Port forwarding) and press Enter

Step 5) Enter TickRate and press enter

Step 6) Enter again to go live

Step 7) now in Host mode, provide clients with port you specified and External IP of your router - port you specify must be that of your port forward
