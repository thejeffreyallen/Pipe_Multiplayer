For Game:

step 1) Copy PipeMultiplayer folder to your Mods folder in PIPE Game folder.


step 2) Copy Appropriate AssemblyC for your game from folder and overwrite existing file in your PIPE_data/Managed (see Setup/For game/PIPE_data/Managed for AssemblyC's), this will depend on what mods you have
installed, There can only be 1 AssemblyC as it contains all code for the game, so editing and saving an assemblyC essentially produces a seperate version of the entire game logic, therefore,
for an AssemblyC to contain 2 mods, the second mod must be done on
the edited AssemblyC of mod 1 and so on, having the wrong AssemblyC for the mods you have can cause anything from no error, to a game that will never boot.


step 3) Copy Setup/For game/PIPE_data/ FrostyMultplayerAssets into your PIPE_Data folder

step 4) Ensure VC_Redist_X86 has been installed, provided in folder but also available from Microsoft.

step 5) See notes for custom player model support
